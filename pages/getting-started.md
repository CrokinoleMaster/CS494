to get started.

###Mapbox JS

If you want to get your maps up easily, you can take a look at Mapbox. Mapbox
hosts your maps so you can fetch them already pre-rendered. Mapbox also comes
with TileMill for creating your maps with databases as well as styling your maps.
MapboxJS is used to get your maps to the client. It is extended on top of leaflet.
